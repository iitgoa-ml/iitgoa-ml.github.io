#### Predicting the sea urchin fertilization with varying pH 

*Abhilasha Gupta, RajHansini Khoiwal, Neeraj Khatri, Devraj Mogaveera* 

Sea urchins are small, spiny marine organisms. They are important to their ecosystem as they help to maintain the number of algae in the ocean. They are also called the grazers of the ocean. Algae are important because they produce oxygen. The fertilization of sea urchin species Strongylocentrotus purpuratus varies with varying pH.

"Global Warming"---a.k.a. the climate change---is the rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system and its related effects. The climate change (CC) had and will have serious effects such as the extinction of species, extensive melting of glacier ice in the Arctic and Antarctic, the sea level rise around the world. This project was about using machine learning (ML) algorithms to find various factors responsible for the increase in temperature in the last few centuries.

India is the second largest country having a population of about 1.32 billion. Agriculture is the main resource and a large segment of citizens are agriculture-dependent. The goal of precision agriculture is to define a decision support system for entire agriculture management with the goal of optimizing returns on inputs while preserving resources. Several related problems in India can be solved in the field of agriculture (production/cultivation), which could benefit the humankind. The project encompasses building a theoretical model using achine Learning (ML) techniques to find out prime factor affecting a cropâ€™s yield, to achieve sustainable agriculture.
